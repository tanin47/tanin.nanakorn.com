I've been taking notes for a few years now and gone through different processes of note taking. Recently, I've arrived at a good process and wanted to share what it looks like.

I carry a small physical notebook with me everywhere. There are 3 categories that I always note: (1) to-do items, (2) questions, and (3) notable info. Then, later on, I transfer these notes into a digital form.

Noting to-do items is the most important one. When someone asks me to do something, I'll never want to forget about it. Noting the deadline is as important. Write it down.

Noting questions makes me more informed. If a question pops up in your mind, note it immediately. No matter how dumb the question seems. Don't even think about answering it. Just write it down.

Though notable info sounds vague, I have a low threshold for it. If something surprises me or I didn't know before, I write it down.

Here you might notice a theme, "just write it down". I write it down without thinking. When I write down a to-do item, I don't think about what it entails. When I write down a question, I don't think about the answer. When I write down notable info, I don't label it as good or bad. I want to avoid developing impression prematurely. Writing it down without judgement frees my mind from worry (that I might forget them in the future) and allows me to focus on the conversation at hand.

One skill developed with this note taking process is "Suspended judgement", the ability to acknowledge without judging. It's something I'm looking forward to getting better at over time.

Later, when I have free time, I would go through my notes. One by one, I would think about it deeply, transfer the item to a digital form, and cross it out from my physical notebook. If there's an unanswered question, this would be a good time to ask these questions, maybe, through email.

Transferring notes from its physical form to the digital form is an extremely beneficial action. It forces me to look at the notes again; this yields one more occurrence of Spaced Repetition, which helps me retain important info. The solitude while reviewing notes also allows me time to reflect about what I noted.

My note taking setup is rather simple. I use [a mini Rocketbook](https://www.amazon.com/Rocketbook-Everlast-Reusable-Notebook-EVR-M-K/dp/B07CZFM72V) with [a 4-color Frixion pen](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Frixion-Ball4-Ballpoint-LKFB-80EF-W/dp/B00IPD3KEM). With this combination, we can [reuse the notebook forever](https://youtu.be/vRHfpKj35Sk?t=260). On the digital side, I store notes in plaintext and sync to Github using my homegrown [Git Notes](https://github.com/tanin47/git-notes) app.

Taking notes is a very personal process. What works for me might not works for you. You'll need to iterate at your own pace to figure out what you like and don't like. My general advice is to approach it casually. Don't stretch yourself too much. Push for more only when you are comfortable with your current level. Currently, I only note in bullet points: `Â·` (dot) for tasks, `?` (question mark) for question, and `-` (dash) for noteable info. I want to explore a more sophisticated format, but I'm not ready yet.

I hope my note taking process serves as one example that you can take and personalize to suit your style. Happy noting!
